x=4
p_x= 0x7ffdf4568bdc
*p_x =4 
value at p_x =4
0x7ffdf4568be0
Here on adding one to p_x it adds 4 bytes 
     For Ex:_ if p_x stored 1st loaction then p_x will be equal to the 5 th location
p_p_x = 0x7ffdf4568be0 the value of location of p_x
*p_p_x = 0x7ffdf4568bdc the value of p_x which is &x
**p_p_x = 4 the value of x
